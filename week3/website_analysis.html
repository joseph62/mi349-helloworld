<h2>Mapping</h2>

<p>Trello uses a fairly simple interface for lists and cards.
Adding a card simply requires you to type the contents of the card into
the text dialog box and hit the create button. The process for adding a list
is very similar.</p>
<h2>Chunking</h2>

<p>
    Trello provides an clear divide between content and control.
    The menu interface allows you to make any important changes to the way the
    board functions while also providing a list of changes made to the board.
</p>
<h2>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h2>

<p>
    Trello's layout provides a very high S/N ratio by allowing you to dismiss controls
    when they are not needed. This allows users to focus solely on the content in the board.
</p>
<h2>Modularity</h2>

    Trello's board is uniquely flexible and allows for users to be able to
    utilize it to coordinate group efforts and solo endeavors alike!
