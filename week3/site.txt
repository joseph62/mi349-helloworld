Site Sections

Landing Page:
    The landing page should have a nice picture of myself.
    This section will have a little information about me and
    what I've done.

About Me:
    This page should go more in depth about me personally.
    There should be some hobbyist interests in this section as well.

Experience:
    This page will have content that could be resume material.
    Work experience and projects go here. Skills and programming
    knowledge should also exist on this page.

Projects:
    Where projects should live. Maybe have a couple of past projects
    and a link to my github.
