<h1>One-Pager for Sean Joseph's Homepage</h1>
<h2>Short Pitch</h2>
<p>Sean Joseph's homepage will act as a professional portfolio.</p>
<h2>Long Pitch</h2>
<p>
    www.egr.msu.edu/~joseph62 will primarily focus on showing off
    Sean Joseph. The page will market him by listing projects that
    he has taken part in, previous and current work experience, and
    passions. The homepage should also link off to some active projects.
</p>
<h2>Personas</h2>
<p>
    This page is meant to target any future employers
    or perspective clients.
</p>
<h2>Comps</h2>
<p>
    This website should function similarly to an
    artist's page. It is meant to showcase talents.
