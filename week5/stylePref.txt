The first tile does not seem as cohesive as the second tile. A little bit of
that has to do with the fact that I'm not very good with gimp and I was
slightly improving as I went. Tile 2 has a nice dark theme, though I think
red/black/grey might be a little overused. I can't deny that I like it, I just
don't know if it's the look I want for my final site. If I had to choose, I'd
go with the second tile style. Maybe I can think of a theme that more properly
fits a look that I want to have.
