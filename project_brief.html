<h1>Project Brief: Sean Joseph's Homepage</h1>
<p>
    Sean Joseph would like to have a fully fleshed out website
    that he can use as an about me. This page should have content
    including a current picture, employment history, current and past
    projects, education history. Ideally this website would function
    as a resume of sorts.
